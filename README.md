# Xtern-Project
Hello! Welcome to my two day Foodie plan in Indianapolis! 

In this project, I collected data using a custom web scraping tool (I didn't use an API, as I was informed via email that it wasn't necessary). I specifically gathered information about food trucks in the Indianapolis area. After obtaining the data, I took steps to improve its quality. I reorganized and renamed the columns, and applied some pre-filtering to ensure its accuracy. You can get a sneak peek of this processed data by referring to the "Final Food Truck Data.png" file. The raw data is also included as "food.csv"

I ensured that the food trucks I selected were open on Saturdays and Sundays during the times I had in mind, and I applied filtering accordingly. You can view the specific plans for both Saturday and Sunday in the "Saturday Plan.png" and "Sunday Plan.png" files. I also calculated the distances between these chosen locations and estimated the driving times using data from the Google API. Furthermore, I determined the mode of transportation to be by car since all the distances between the food trucks were greater than 0.5 km, which is a reasonable walking distance. If you want to reproduce this data, you can do so by entering your Google API key in line 9 of the "Xtern Foodie Plan no API key. R" file.

I generated two plots that display the locations and the routes for each day. These routes are a general representation of the path to follow, indicating the sequence of stops. I intentionally excluded specific car road routes since traffic conditions during the event might not align with the data I obtained through the API. Instead, the routes focus on guiding you from one location to the next. You can find these plots in "Saturday Route.pdf" and "Sunday Route.pdf"

After finalizing my Foodie plan, I delved into a deeper exploration of the available data. My objective was to gain insights into the distribution of various cuisines among the food trucks in Indianapolis. You can check out pie chart in the"Food Truck Cuisine.png".  It came as no surprise that the majority of food trucks fell into the category of serving multiple cuisines. This category encompasses a diverse range of food trucks, including those classified as delivery restaurants (which allow you to order food), mobile caterers, and food courts (many of which feature food trucks either within or nearby). For more specific details, please refer to the "Xtern Foodie Plan no API key.R" file. Additionally, Mexican cuisine stood out as exceptionally popular among the food trucks. It's worth noting that within the realm of Mexican cuisine, there are distinctions, such as Mexican food trucks offering various Mexican dishes, taco trucks exclusively serving tacos, and Mexican torta trucks specializing in Mexican sandwiches.

I turned my attention to the average ratings of food trucks within each cuisine, with the exclusion of those falling under the "multiple cuisines" category and some other cuisines that lacked reviews. You can find this graph in "Rating by Cuisine.png". I was surprised to see the highest-rated food trucks belonged to the Salvadorian and gyro cuisine categories. It's worth considering that in some cases, individuals who aren't fond of a particular cuisine may refrain from giving low ratings because their aversion might be to the cuisine itself rather than the quality of the food.
