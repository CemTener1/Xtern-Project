# Xtern-Project
Hello! Welcome to my two day Foodie plan in Indianapolis! 

In this project, I collected data using a custom web scraping tool (I didn't use an API, as I was informed via email that it wasn't necessary). I specifically gathered information about food trucks in the Indianapolis area. After obtaining the data, I took steps to improve its quality. I reorganized and renamed the columns, and applied some pre-filtering to ensure its accuracy. You can get a sneak peek of this processed data by referring to the "Final Food Truck Data.png" file.

I ensured that the food trucks I selected were open on Saturdays and Sundays during the times I had in mind, and I applied filtering accordingly. You can view the specific plans for both Saturday and Sunday in the "Saturday Plan.png" and "Sunday Plan.png" files. I also calculated the distances between these chosen locations and estimated the driving times using data from the Google API. Furthermore, I determined the mode of transportation to be by car since all the distances between the food trucks were greater than 0.5 km, which is a reasonable walking distance. If you want to reproduce this data, you can do so by entering your Google API key in line 9 of the "Xtern Foodie Plan no API key. R" file.
