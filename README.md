# Xtern-Project
Hello! Welcome to my two day Foodie plan in Indianapolis! In this project, I gathered data from an online webscraper and got relevant information of food trucks in Indianapolis. I renamed the columns of my data and made a pre filtering. To find the preview of the data I worked with check the "Final Food Truck Data.png"
